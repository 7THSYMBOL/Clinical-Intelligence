          <p>Clinical Intelligence or Clinical business intelligence </p>

<p>Clinical intelligence is an emerging field in healthcare that will change nursing practice, driving clinical outcomes and operational efficiencies. Clinical intelligence is essential to healthcare organizations in fully realizing the value of the growing amount of data being generated through electronic health records and other clinical information systems. </p>

<p>Clinical Intelligence is the use of data analysis to improve care delivery. Clinical business intelligence (i.e., clinical analytics) refers to a broad category of information technologies that gather data created during the delivery of medical care and analyze that clinical data to help managers and clinicians make better decisions.</p>

<p>Clinical business intelligence is an essential tool for health systems pursuing clinical transformation as they take action to dramatically improve their performance in terms of cost and quality. Improving performance requires insight into "what works" and "what does not work," as well as intelligent systems to ensure that the best care is delivered. Clinical business intelligence can provide insight and intelligence, making it an essential tool for health systems pursuing clinical transformation.</p>

<p>Clinical performance measures focus on specific processes and outcomes that are important to achieving the health system's overall organizational goals. Many hospitals and health systems have explicitly stated their overall mission and goals in terms inspired in part by the concept of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement's "triple aim,"</p>

<p>The components of the Triple Aim are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Improving the patient experience of care (including quality and satisfaction)</li>
<li>Improving the health of populations</li>
<li>Reducing the per capita cost of health care
Many health systems track their overall performance using a balanced scorecard that includes specific quantifiable measures aligned with goals similar to those in the triple aim. </li>
</ul>
